Instructions
------------

 - Best in Chrome or Safari - AR dinosaur demo requires Chrome Dev or Chrome Canary (for WebRTC support)
 - Best viewed in 4:3 ratio - ideal is full screen at 1024x768 (standard projector resolution)
 - Lots of big images so best to load up locally or view over a broadband connection
